# Fairly

### Fairly is a SaaS platform enabling talent acquisition teams to quickly find and hire high quality diverse talent. This product is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can only provide code snippets of my work.
My role as a software engineer on this project was to handle the compensation package feature on the application. I handled all of the code from the back-end to the front-end. Below is a list of actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

• Created a fully responsive dashboard that enables compensation packages to be added and managed by hiring admins and organization admins.

• Constructed a feature that allows the currently logged in user to be associated with only 1 organization at a time.

• Managed SQL Server composite tables with <strong> primary </strong> and <strong> foreign key </strong> relationships and wrote stored procedures involving joins, calculations, and subqueries.

• Created elaborate API controllers and services in <strong>.NET </strong> and <strong>C#</strong> to ensure seamless integration with the application's front-end and back-end.

•Tested API functionality using Postman to ensure endpoints were working properly to avoid potential bugs or errors before deployment.

•Communicated current progress of tasks in <strong>AGILE/SCRUM</strong> environment with team members through daily stand-up meetings and code reviews.

•Operated with a highly functional system of source control and workflow management through Git, GitHub, Slack, and Trello.

•Effectively managed Git branches by creating and merging feature branches, resolving <strong>merge conflicts</strong>, and ensuring stability of the main branch using <strong>pull requests</strong>.
